This project contains the code files we have finished for the first sprint of our Tiba Health app development process.
Generally, our app is able to implement these functionality and features: 1 Store into and retrieve data from firebase and make sure the data transmitted and processed properly; 2 Display and organize the data in ways that make sense, according to what it is exactly used for, the data can be transferred and utilized between different interfaces; 3 Connect to email server which has been installed in the android os and contact to others through email sending; 4 A series of friendly user interfaces though which the user will be able to easily figure out how to use our app and have excellent user experience.
Specifically, our “baby” Tiba Health app is able to offer the following service to the user: 1 List the exercise plan for user, the detail information about each exercise shall be seen after tapping that task; 2 Display the respective instruction for each task in a pre-designed order; 3 Count the time for each exercise once the user ready to start and stop counting if the user chooses to; 4 The user is able to edit some account information including uploading a image file as photo; 5 The user is able to send email to his PT or other (Note: the email only function properly if the email application on the test emulator/machine was signed in by a real email account, that will be the sender email address).
Our app was implemented on Android Studio API 25 and SDK 7.1.1 platform, the emulator we chose to test our code is Nexus_4.
Play with our app and have fun!
